# react-quiz

### What is this?
Courtesy of `create-react-app`, I've bootstrapped a simple application.

### Why do this?
Because it's a nice way to learn React, and I want to show off my work ðŸ™‚.

### What else do I need to know?
Not much... but I do suggest looking at these links:

* [Deploying a site to GitHub pages](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089)
